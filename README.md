# Scouting Adventures
My name is Alex Jones-Kesinger, and this is my first public game! I am a Boy Scout, and I have several friends who are not in Scouts, but want to try it without being comited to anything. That's where I got the idea for Scouting Adventures! This is a great way to see what Scouting is all about, online! It is still under construction, but it is public. I want to eventually turn this into an awesome multi-player game with achievments, fundraisers, weekend and week long campouts, and so much more!
